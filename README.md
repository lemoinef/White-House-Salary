# Project: Analyzing Movie Reviews

In this project, we'll be working with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data about the White House payroll. This is the first data science project of Dataquest.

## Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `white_house_salary.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Analyzing Movie Reviews/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
jupyter notebook white_house_salary.ipynb
```

or
```
ipython notebook white_house_salary.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is included as `2015_white_house.csv`. This dataset is provided by FiveThirtyEight.
